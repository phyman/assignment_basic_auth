### Tasks:

1. Implement HTTP Basic Authentication for your application
1. Allow visitors to access the Users INDEX and SHOW actions.
1. Test to make sure your auth is working properly. Observe that your browser remembers your auth status behind the scenes. Try this in an incognito/anonymous browser session and clear out the cookies to see when/if the session is persisted.
1. Do the credentials show up in the params? In the developer tools?
1. Try opening up the Network tab of your Developer Tools in a new session and viewing the HTTP request that your browser sends along.
1. Commit
1. Now that you're comfortable with HTTP Basic, change your app to HTTP Digest Authentication and explore using the same steps.
